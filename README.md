  <h3>
    ℹ️ Information ℹ️
  </h3>
  <br>
  <span> The Riot Games launcher made with React, Redux and Base CSS. </span> 
  
  <span> Riot Games is an American company that focuses on competitive games, such as League of Legends, Valorant and Teamfight Tactics. It was founded in September 2006 and it's one of the greatest game companies on the actual days. </span>
  
  <span> My objective is to try to replicate their launcher but adding other features, such as a register page directly on the launcher. I'll try to add other ideas that comes to my mind as I develop this project. </span>

    💡 Future Ideas 💡
  </h3>
  <br> 
  <div align="left">
  <p> 01) Adding a "system" that saves the account registered on the Local Storage to simulate a DB. </p>
  <p> 02) Login can only be done after registering the account on the Local Storage. </p>
  <p> And more to be added...
